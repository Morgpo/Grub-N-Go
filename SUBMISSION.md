### See `./Database/grubngo_backup.sql`

*Implement your ERD using MySQL Server, including 5–10 tables in the schema.*
*Build tables with correctly configured keys and constraints.*

# Data Population:

### See `./Database/grubngo_backup.sql`

*Populate each table with varied data such that queries return different subsets of data based on JOINs or WHERE clauses.*
*Each table should have at least 24 records unless otherwise justified.*

# Queries and Automation ( *.sql file):

### See `./Database/Queries_and_Automation.sql`

*Prepare and test the following for demonstration:*
*A report query using a JOIN to report on an aggregate value with a GROUP BY clause.*
*A query with a subquery.*
*A query to create a view and another query to demonstrate its use.*
*A trigger that updates or inserts data based on an insert.*
*A query to demonstrate the trigger's functionality.*

# Exported Schema (*.sql file):

### See `./Database/grubngo_backup.sql`

*Export your schema using MySQL Workbench as a single SQL file.*
*Ensure the file includes the schema, data, triggers, and views.*
